# Driving-license-test
Driving license test that I made using HTML, CSS and JS.

First HTML project made based on [this](https://youtu.be/riDzcEQbX6k) tutorial.  
The questions are from the ["Preguntas de examen - Categor√≠a B"](https://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/sites/gcaba/files/copia_de_examen_-_categoria_b_1.pdf)
PDF provided by buenosaires.gob.ar site  

The test consists of six JSON files, where the JavaScript will grab only five random question of each set so that every test is unique and has all type of questions.
It includes alsmost all the questions from the PDF file including images for those questions that require it.
